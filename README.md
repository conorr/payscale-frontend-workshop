# payscale-frontend-workshop

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repo to your machine: ```git clone https://github.com/conorr/payscale-frontend-workshop.git```
1. Enter the repo and run ```npm install```. If you get an ```EACCES``` error, this is because npm is trying to install a necessary global dependency and cannot due to permissions. Do not try to fix this using sudo! Follow [these instructions]( https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions) instead.
2. Run ```npm run server``` and go to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
